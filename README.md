### Overview

Today we're going to create a REST API that allows other applications to work with GA student data. 

With this API, any external application will be able to: 

- Retrieve all the students in the database 
- Retrieve a single student if the ID is known 
- Add a student to the database 
- Update a student's information 
- Delete a student from the database 

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- Use Node.js
- Make use of the Express web framework for your API 
- Be RESTful (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Use a MongoDB database 
- Use Git to keep track of your progress

### Bonus

* A sample front-end application that utilizes the REST API that you created
